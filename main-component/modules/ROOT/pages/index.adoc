This is a user manual for Test Circle CI.

== Introduction
This project introduces the `Operations` class, that provides the most advanced linear algebra algorithms:

    * `Operations.sum(a, b)`: computes the algebraic sum of `a` and `b`.
    * `Operations.sub(a, b)`: computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
    * `Operations.mul(a, b)`: computes the algebraic product of `a` and `b`.
    * `Operations.div(a, b)`: computes the division of `a` and `b`.

NOTE: This project is not very useful.

== Example use
Extremely complex algorithms can be implemented with few lines of code:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Operations.sum(4, 4)); // OMG
    }
}
